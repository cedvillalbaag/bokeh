# Bokeh Python Library Data Visualization
#DataVisualization #Python   

This is a space dedicated to practicing and consolidating my knowledge of creating interactive visualizations and web dashboards using the powerful Bokeh library with Python.

Here you will find a series of examples and solutions for different data visualization scenarios, ideal for those learning or looking to review key Bokeh concepts. My goal is to explore how Bokeh allows you to create sophisticated graphics that can be directly embedded in web applications or dashboards, offering an interactive user experience.

### About this Repository:
This repository is the result of following one or more Bokeh tutorials. The exercises are designed to cover a range of functionalities, including:

- Basic Charts: Lines, scatter plots, bars, and histograms.
- Interactivity: Zoom, pan, selection, and tooltips (information on hover).
- Widgets: Sliders, buttons, and selectors to control the data or the view.
- Multiple Glyphs: Combining different types of visualizations in a single chart.
- Layouts: Organize multiple charts and widgets into a coherent layout.
- Data Sources: Work with ColumnDataSources to dynamically update charts.
- Save and Export: Save charts as HTML or images.
- Embedding: Understand how to integrate Bokeh visualizations into web pages.
